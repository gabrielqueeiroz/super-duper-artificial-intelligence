This repository has a few jobs I've done related to AI.
<ul>

  <li><b>data:</b> Notebook showing the treatment of a broken sheet, and in the end, a plot about the data.</li>
  <li><b>computerVision:</b> A cascade finder with an interface made with Tkinter. The cascade chosen in the code was the frontal face, but other options are available inside the "cascades" directory. The images chosen to test the cascade are inside "pessoas" directory.</li>
</ul>
